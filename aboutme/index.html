    <h2>Tabitha Corrigan</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Olympia Washington in an amazing family with my mom, dad, and 4 sisters. Although I no longer live at home (I moved
        out a little over a year ago), I still live close enough to my parents to go to their house every weekend. My family has been a huge support
        to me, and have inspired me to do so much.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life, and I have served in a variety of callings in those 20+ years.
        Right now, I am the main Activities Co-chair for the Olympia YSA (Young Single Adult) Branch. I plan and prepare for all the activities in the branch,
        while also encouraging members to come. It's a demanding calling, from meetings on sundays to planning sessions, comming early to set up,
        and making contact with multiple people to for bigger plans and activities. However, despite how busy I am, I genuinly love my calling.
        I have come to love the branch and those I serve. Many people have asked me when I get stressed or overwhelmed why I don't just quit my calling,
        and I think that Heavenly Father put me here to learn patience, perseverence, responsibility, and so many other things. And as far as I'm 
        concerned, I could use as much of those traits as Heavenly Father will give me. Not to mention, I love it, and I don't want to give it up anytime soon.</p>
    <p>I am currently a Dental Assistant at a prediatric dental office. When I started my job, I was the sterilization tech, in charge of all instrument cleaning
        and sterilizing. I did that for about a year, and then my boss offered to train me to be a dental assistant. I accepted, and my sister
        took the job of sterilizing. I do enjoy it; I enjoy working with the kids, talking to their parents, and helping them learn how to care of their teeth,
        but I look forward to the day I graduate and apply for a web developement or computer programming job. I'm excited to work in an office environment,
        have my own desk, computer, and work with my brain to create functional codes for people to use. I have always enjoyed working in the background,
        and this has been my dream job for a very long time.</p>
    <p>I often joke with people that my hobbies are working and school. I feel like that is where the majority of my time goes. I wake up a 5am, I go to work,
        come home, make dinner with my roommate, do some school, and then go to bed so I can do it all over again the next day. That being said, when I'm not working or doing school, I enjoy
        playing video games, building with legos, doodling, playing with my cats, or chilling.</p>
    <p>I am so excited to be here in this class. I have loved programming so far, and I look forward to sharpening my skills and learning more about how to create websites!</p>
