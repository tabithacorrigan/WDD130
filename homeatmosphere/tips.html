            <p>Let’s take a look at the smell of your home. A house usually has a distinctive smell, and it is neither good or bad generally. The smell of your home can be quickly and easily boosted by using a scented candle, wax warmer, or even baking sweets or cooking. Walking into a home that smells of freshly baked cookies or “Caribbean Sunrise” is significantly more welcoming and inviting then a standard scent, or a bad one.</p>
            <p>A bad smell can come from a number of things, and can drive comfort from your home. We can easily become accustomed to the smell of our home and forget about it. Pay attention to how your home smells when you first walk in after you’ve been out for a while, and you can get a glimpse of what your home smells like to guests. It is difficult to cover up a bad smell with the aforementioned tricks, and it will most likely need resolved.</p>
            <p>Smell is often impacted by cleanliness. If you notice a bad smell, start by emptying all the trashes, cleaning the furniture and carpets, emptying pet boxes, cleaning the garbage disposal in your sink, and other cleaning jobs. Start by targeting the kitchen and bathroom, where most negative smells can origianate from, and cleaning anything that could be damaging the natural smell of your home.</p>
            <p>Cleanliness can not only affect the smell of your home, but also the comforting and inviting atmosphere you want to achieve. By keeping things tidy and pulled together, your guest will feel comfortable in your home, and enjoy their visit. Try to ensure that everything has a “spot” and is put away properly. Make sure that very few things go on the floor. As a general rule, if it’s not furniture, it shouldn’t be on the floor. There are always exceptions to rules, but make sure that you can easily and effortlessly maneuver through your home with no fear of tripping or stepping on something. </p>
            <p>If you find it difficult to keep your home clean, don’t worry! You aren’t alone. With busy schedules and multiple responsibilities, it is incredibly difficult to stay on top of it all. Just remember that your friends love you, and your best is good enough for them. You live in your home, and life happens. And that in itself is something to keep in mind as well. The impeccably clean and sterile environment can also damage the atmosphere in your home as well. Allow yourself to relax and have a good time, and don’t worry too much about maintaining 100% clean the whole time you have guests over.</p>
