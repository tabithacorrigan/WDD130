      <p>
        You want your home to feel “lived in” and “homey” for maximum comfort. Because regardless of whether or not you have a guest in your home, you want it to feel good for you. And if it feels good to you, it will feel good for your friends! 
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Decor</h3>
      <p>
        Balancing “too much” and “not enough” into a “just right” makes a huge impact on how your home feels. Your home should be an extension of you to help your guests feel at home. Your guests are a part of your life, and regardless of how long you’ve known them or how many times they’ve been to your house, they know you and your personality. They may feel most at home when your decorations are an extension of who are you. If you like color, use color! If you like monotone with accents, use it! Use personal items from you past and photos capturing memories to decorate. Allow your personality to shine through your décor so that you and your guests can relax properly. 

        How do you do it?
        
        Fill available space! If you have an empty wall, throw some pictures on it, particularly of your family or friends doing something fun. 
        
        Don’t be afraid of putting up a shelf for small, important and/or decorative items. Use a combination of tall and short items for a classy and staggered appearance. Feel free to pick up a piece of furniture that has space for decorative items, such as an entertainment center where you can place not only the television set and gaming consuls, but also a vase of flowers, family photos, a small statuette, or a combination of things! 
        
        However, it is notoriously easy to go from “classy” to “cluttered”, especially if you have many prized items or photos you want to display. Ideally, for a good balance, you should be able to walk round without stepping over things or maneuvering around furniture, you should be able to see plenty of whitespace on the walls, and you should be able to see the majority of the shelves that your items are sitting on.
        
        If you find yourself with more items than can comfortably fit, don’t worry! There are things you can do.
        •	Downsize - This one can be tricky, particularly for those with multiple highly sentimental pieces. Take a moment to go through your things and decide what you want to keep what you want to donate, or what can be thrown out. 
        •	Rotate – If you have more items than space available, put out some of them and then place the rest in a easily accessible storage spot where you can switch them out anytime you’d like.
        •	Designated areas – Condense your items into smaller spaces, such as an album for your framed photos or a display case for your collections.

      </ul>
      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Just as simple as décor, but often overlooked, is the environment of your home. Multiple factors go into building an environment, and some of them go hand in hand.
For example, let’s take the smell of your home. A house usually has a distinctive smell, and it is neither good or bad generally. The smell of your home can be quickly and easily boosted by using a scented candle, wax warmer, or even baking sweets or cooking. Walking into a home that smells of freshly baked cookies or “Caribbean Sunrise” is significantly more welcoming and inviting then a standard scent, or a bad one.
A bad smell can come from a number of things, and can drive comfort from your home. We can easily become accustomed to the smell of our home and forget about it. Pay attention to how your home smells when you first walk in after you’ve been out for a while, and you can get a glimpse of what your home smells like to guests. It is difficult to cover up a bad smell with the aforementioned tricks, and it will most likely need resolved.
Smell is often impacted by cleanliness. If you notice a bad smell, start by emptying all the trashes, cleaning the furniture and carpets, emptying pet boxes, cleaning the garbage disposal in your sink, and other cleaning jobs. Start by targeting the kitchen and bathroom, where many negative smells can come from, and cleaning anything that could be damaging the natural smell of your home.
Cleanliness can not only affect the smell of your home, but also the comforting and inviting atmosphere you want to achieve. By keeping things tidy and pulled together, your guest will feel comfortable in your home, and enjoy their visit. Try to ensure that everything has a “spot” and is put away properly. Make sure that very few things go on the floor. As a general rule, if it’s not furniture, it shouldn’t be on the floor. There are always exceptions to rules, but make sure that you can easily and effortlessly maneuver through your home with no fear of tripping or stepping on something. 
If you find it difficult to keep your home clean, don’t worry! You aren’t alone. With busy schedules and multiple responsibilities, it is incredibly difficult to stay on top of it all. Just remember that your friends love you, and your best is good enough for them. You live in your home, and life happens. And that in itself is something to keep in mind as well. The impeccably clean and sterile environment can also damage the atmosphere in your home as well. Allow yourself to relax and have a good time, and don’t worry too much about maintaining 100% clean the whole time you have guests over.
